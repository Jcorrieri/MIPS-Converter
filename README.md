# MIPS Converter

My first Java project. This is based on an in-class assignment in which we were asked to convert MIPS assembly instructions to hex code by hand. It is designed to take text files containing Mips instructions, binary code, or hex code and convert the contents to the corresponding output. 

## Input File Format

The input file should be a plain text file (.txt) containing MIPS assembly instructions, binary instructions, or hex instructions. The following screenshot shows the supported line format as well as all currently supported MIPS instructions:

## Installation

Currently, there is no way to install the project.

## Usage

This program can perform three main tasks: Convert MIPS instructions to hexadecimal instructions, convert MIPS instructions to binary instructions, and perform small conversions between decimal, binary, and hexadecimal values. 

## Additional Info

For the purposes of this project, I have coded the algorithms for converting decimal, binary, and hexadecimal values myself. 

## Contributing

I am not currently looking for any outside contributions, this is simply a personal project to get my feet in the water.
